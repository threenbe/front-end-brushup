# front-end-brushup
 I've only ever jumped into HTML/CSS/Javascript blindly at work and it's mostly worked out, but I'm trying to formally brush up the basics now in order to glean a better understanding of what I'm actually doing and such so here's a start on that.
 
 I used Visual Studio Code. Each folder is just a different folder I was working out of when trying things out.
